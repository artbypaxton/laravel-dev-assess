## Title: Users reporting that some text on posts is difficult to read
___
Description: We've been getting several support tickets from users saying that some of the text on the blog post page is difficult to read. I know we've used something called Lighthouse in the past to look at related issues. It's important to us that our website is accessible to all of our users. Can you look into this and try to make corrections to the affected areas?
